				<h3>Instructions: </h3>
			<p>How to play the Game:<br>
			In Clone Collapse you must click on a colored Cube that connects to at least two more cubes of the same color as the cube you clicked.
			A new row will generate random cubes one at a time at the bottom of the screen. When the new row is complete it will advance upwards.<br><br>
			To Win: You must prevent the cubes from going beyond the top of screen before the timer reaches zero.  When a cube touches the top of the screen, all the cubes will begin to shake as a warning.  At this time you will have the time it takes for a new row to generate before you lose.</p>
